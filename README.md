## Overview

This module isn't intended to be used as a standalone module. It exists to provide access to simple repeated-usage functional datatypes for development purposes but anything used in this module should be extracted and included into whatever project its used in as a standalone program. It is suggested to maintain the structure of the module as it is, simply patching in whatever scripts you require when you require them (take care with inter-module dependencies).
